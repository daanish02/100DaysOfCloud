# Day 12 – Add and Manage Tags for Azure Virtual Machines

## Problem Statement
The Nautilus DevOps team is migrating a portion of their infrastructure to 
Azure. During the migration, they have created several 
virtual machines (VMs) in different regions. The team has identified 
one VM that is not tagged properly so they decided to tag it as needed.

- Add the tag `Environment=dev` to the virtual machine named `datacenter-vm`.

## Objective
Add and manage tags for an Azure Virtual Machine to improve organization and resource management.

## Steps

1. Log in to the Azure Portal using your credentials.
2. Search for and open the target **Virtual Machine**.
3. In the VM menu, select **Tags**.
4. Enter the required **Key–Value** tag pair.
5. Click **Apply** to save the tags.

## Result
Tags are successfully added to the Azure Virtual Machine and can be used for filtering, cost management, and governance.
